I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in pharmacoepidemiology, with a focus on leveraging real-world evidence to address questions of drug safety and effectiveness. I hope to answer causal questions with observational data to help the patients and clinicians. 

Some of my recent work has examined the CVD complications following COVID-19 vaccination, as well as the effects of PPI use. Additionally, I have investigated the effectiveness of the COVID-19 vaccine, PCV and riluzole.
